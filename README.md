This app was created with yt tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM, but I've decided to do some parts my way. 
Instead of using web scrapping, I've used good old-fashion API. This way even if the page changes their architecture, I will still get my data. 
What is more, I simplified the code, making it much shorter and 'pythonic'.
